To obtain tokens, not only in the traditional PVE mode, but also in the PVP competitive mode, players have to manipulate skilled techniques. Players can gain new friends while acquiring assets in different scenes of the game through constellation immigrants of different levels. Based on the role of constellation immigrants, Genesis has created NFT assets such as space debris, virtual buildings, character equipment and so on. Pave the way for building Richverse virtual social network in the future.'
